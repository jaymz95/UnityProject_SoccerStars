- Enemy idle animation ran at 6 FPS
- Enemy walking animation ran at 5 FPS 
(note: added a no gun animation in case you want to use it somewhere - totally optional
could do enemies dont pull out gun while moving until within a distance of them or something- just an idea)

- Enemy Boss walking movement and idle movement done at 3 FPS

- Main Character idle movement ran at 4 FPS
- Main Character movement ran at 7 FPS
- Kicking movements done at 5 FPS

- Also feel free to change FPS rates to make it what you think looks best
, just letting you know the FPS I animated them at, as a basis to go off.

- Feel free to change the background or even a different one for each level.
- The level designs i had are a grassy one, stony one and desert one. but feel free again to change that if you dont like my suggestions

Also Sorry they look shit, I'm useless at graphics. :(
